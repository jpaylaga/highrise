# Java Test Project
> A Java Web Project with Play Framework 1 that will access contact information from highrise HQ.

## Summary ##

This is my test project that was accepted for my job application at [Cazoomi](https://www.cazoomi.com/) - a company based in San Francisco, California, USA. The following are the instructions for this test:

Candidate should create a simple play framework v1 (not v2) project to interact with Highrise API and put it on github:

1. Register a free Highrise account (https://hello.highrisehq.com/signup/free/new)
2. Learn Highrise API for contact retrieval
3. Create a page that retrieve contacts from Highrise for a specified tag name (form input) then put the returned data into database. Please create two JPA entities only, for tag and contact with proper relationship (many to many).
4. Create another page that displays retrieved data from database (populated by step 3). Add a tag filter (combobox) and display contacts filtered with selected tag.
5. Upload the project in github.com using a free account and send me the github url so I can review it. 

No third party library should be used other than provided by play v1 plus the following libs:

* Simple XML for XML parsing
http://simple.sourceforge.net/
* Jersey HTTP client for sending API request
https://jersey.java.net/documentation/latest/client.html

Please use Google if you need more detailed information.
